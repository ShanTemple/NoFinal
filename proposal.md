# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Haunted maze game based on things that are scary for college students. It will include exam due dates, networking events, group projects, etc. You must find the exit of the game before you are caught by the Final Exam Monster

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It will be a 3D, point of view maze game. We will use either Unreal engine or Unity depending on which Youtube tutorial we favor more. The walls and seperate rooms will have a theme. For example, one theme will be based on group projects while another room will be designed as an advisor asking you to schedule a meeting with them. Additionally, there will be college freshman asking the player where the parties are at and another design that where a politcal canvasser is asking to 5 minutes of your time to speak about candidates. The main object of the game is to find the end of the maze before the ultimate monster gets you: The Final Exam Monster.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Other Classmate: Shalini Joy
Email: shalini.joy@temple.edu
Their TA: Negar Koushki

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, we will design a haunted maze with the final exam monster chasing the player.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Hopefully, we will be able to add the additional designs and monsters of the freshman and an advisor.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Ideally, we will also be able to add the group project monster and politcal canvasser monster.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
