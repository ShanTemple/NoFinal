# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Idea 1:
- A Haunted maze game based on things that are scary for college students
- Includes: Exam due dates, networking events, group projects, etc. You must
    find the exit of the game before you are caught by the Final Exam Monster

Idea 2:
- Tower defense game
- Includes: People that are scary for college student coming towards the tower
    like profesors, freshman, dean, politcal canvasers, etc.;
    Each person will have a different defense strength that's inflicted if
    they reach the tower. To stop them, they must be shot away with pens (or
    some other PG gun)
